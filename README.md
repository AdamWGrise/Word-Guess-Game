# Word-Guess-Game / Hangman

My first JavaScript game, this is a Hangman-style puzzle with a woodworking shop theme. It features a small library of possible words, snarky responses and words of praise based on whether or not guesses were correct, and my first experience utilizing variables, functions, arrays, and loops in a fully-functional application.

I couldn't bring myself to call it Hangman, as my wife so very scathingly pointed out, "Where's the hangman?"
